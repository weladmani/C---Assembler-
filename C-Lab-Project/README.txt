project structure
1. pre-processing: search for macros and replace them with the code they represent
2. first pass: The first pass identifies labels and assigns them numerical values representing their corresponding memory addresses.
3. second pass: In the second pass, the assembler generates the final machine code

Usage: ./assembler file_name_1 ... file_name_N
